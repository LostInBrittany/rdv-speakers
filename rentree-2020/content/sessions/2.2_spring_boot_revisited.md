The first angle of this talk is a comparison between Kotlin and Java 15 when used to build and use DSLs like KoFu and JaFu to configure Spring Boot from https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-fu.

The second aspect covered is the key advantage offered by Spring infrastructure configured in a functional way, and how it could shape the future of the Spring portfolio: lower memory consumption, faster startup and smaller GraalVM-native image.

We’ll also share our thoughts about the advantages of configuring Spring Boot explicitly with this approach: you are fully in control of what features you enable or not.
